# Twimba - A Scimba-themed Twitter Clone

<div align="center"><img src="./screenshots/initial.png" alt="Twitter clone"></div>

This is the 3rd project in the **[Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) Frontend Developer Career Path**'s **Module 5** on **Essential JavaScript**.

I completed a previous iteration of Module 5 and heard that it was completely re-done. _Scrimba's always updating their awesome courses._ I had (re)learned some concepts and newly learned about `FormData` in the _fun-evil_ **[Cookie Consent project](https://github.com/JoleneKearse/cookie-consent)** and found the topics covered here to be exciting. I was really excited to discover how the **reply**, **like** & **retweet** buttons would be implemented. I worked on the \*\*[Oldagram Instagram clone](https://github.com/JoleneKearse/oldagram), but moved on to other things (_a freelance project, and work with a team of fellow development learners_) before I got my like button working.

So let's go see what cool new things I learn here!
