# Twimba - A Scimba-themed Twitter Clone

<div align="center"><img src="./screenshots/initial.png" alt="Twitter clone"></div>

This is the 3rd project in the **[Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) Frontend Developer Career Path**'s **Module 5** on **Essential JavaScript**.

I completed a previous iteration of Module 5 and heard that it was completely re-done. _Scrimba's always updating their awesome courses._ I had (re)learned some concepts and newly learned about `FormData` in the _fun-evil_ **[Cookie Consent project](https://github.com/JoleneKearse/cookie-consent)** and found the topics covered here to be exciting. I was really excited to discover how the **reply**, **like** & **retweet** buttons would be implemented. I worked on the \*\*[Oldagram Instagram clone](https://github.com/JoleneKearse/oldagram), but moved on to other things (_a freelance project, and work with a team of fellow development learners_) before I got my like button working.

## Things this Project will Teach

- the `.forEach()` method
- `CDN`s or **Content Delivery Networks** to **add icons** and **generate UUIDs**
- `textarea`
- **data attributes** to store info in an HTML element
- conditionally render styles
- logical not operator, `!`

So let's go see what cool new things I learn here!

## Brand-new Knowledge

### Breaking JS into Modules

_I was thrilled to see this, as it was originally why I had returned to Module 5! I love React's components, if for nothing else besides being able to view areas of JS code in different files, but hadn't successfully done it in JavaScript._

### uuid

A `uuid` is a **universally unique identifier**. It's common for **data sets** to have such a **key** to _ahem_ identify the **data blocks**. Each of the tweets will have one.
